This is just a README file that contains project ideas that will turn into real software solutions<br>

# List:<br>
*Catering App* : an app that contains two types apps - for caterers and for users where users can see meals offered for the day and select meal plans for pickup. Their meals are then picked up by the caterers who prepare the meal and mark it as complete. After the order is complete the person may see their order show a QR code with which they are able to then verify with the caterers that they ordered something. Once the QR code is scanned the caterers then complete this transaction by marking the order as complete and both parties complete their journies. Designed for larger companies that employ cateres for meals, therefore allowing people to order their meals beforehand and giving the caterers a longer period to make the meals, wasting less time waiting in lines as well as wasting less food since we only make food based on what was ordered. Reduces waste, cost, and time consumed during lunch time (less time waiting more time enjoying the well-deserved lunch break).<br><br>
Requirements: 
- Standard User App
- Caterer App
- DB for orders
- Possible HTTP server to handle requests
<br>*more planned for later*
